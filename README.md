eslint-config-flying-sheep
==========================

As most people, I really like [`eslint-config-airbnb`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

But Iâ€™m also hard-set on some stylistic choices (;-less, tabs) and like to use some slightly advanced patterns like `x == null` (to test for null or undefined).

Example `.eslintrc`:

```json
{
  "extends": "flying-sheep"
}
```
